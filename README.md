## Notes & appreciations

I created this org-chart when I was hired by [TeamApps](https://github.com/teamapps-org).

Although this Org chart was specifically created for [teamapps java web application framework](https://github.com/teamapps-org/teamapps) , it's very flexible and can be used in any environment, where d3 and DOM is accessible.

Big thanks to [Matthias](https://github.com/Matthias-Bernstein) and [Yann](https://github.com/yamass), who assembled requirements for org-chart and had valuable pieces of advice afterwads.

Also, thanks all people who made generous [donations](https://ko-fi.com/bumbeishvili), it gives me motivation to further improve this org chart component.

Thanks [contractzen](https://www.contractzen.com/) for the significant contribution, which made implementation of some of the most important features (optimal layout, exporting ) possible.
